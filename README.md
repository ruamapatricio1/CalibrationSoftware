# Calibration Software

The calibration of a measuring system plays an important role in this process, since it is a mechanism that ensures the reliability of measuring systems, whose ratification is attested by recognized and valid calibration certificates. The contribution of this work is the development of a web platform for calibration of measurement systems that manage and elaborate calibration reports according to NBR ISO IEC / 17025, NIT-DICLA-021, ISO GUM and EA-4 / 02M standards. developing it was carried out the survey of requirements through the incremental interactive model and software engineering techniques.
